# COMP1151 Game Prototype

## Learning Outcomes

## Deliverables:

* A link to a playable prototype of the game, uploaded to itch.io.
* The Unity project for the game
* A design document
* A techinical implementation documemnt

## Design Task



## Implementation Task

Your game must be built in **Unity 6.0.40f1**. This is the version we will use for marking. Any errors caused by using the incorrect version will cost you marks.

Your game must be developed using the Visual Scripting system in Unity. We will not mark any other code in your project. 

Your game should demonstrate use of the following features. Marks will be assigned for correct implementation of each feature, as indicated below.

### Movement using Transform (10%)

At least one object in the scene should be moved using the Transform component (with or without a Kinematic Rigidbody). This object should not be affected by physics.

### Movement using Rigidbody (5%)

At least one object in the scene should be moved using a dynamic Rigidbody component, and should be affected by collisions with obstacles in the scene.

### Keyboard Controls using an Input Asset (5%)

A keyboard control mapping for the player avatar should be implemented using an Input Asset. 

### Gamepad Controls using an Input Asset (5%)

A gamepad control mapping for the player avatar should be implemented using an Input Asset. 

### Trigger Colliders (5%)

At least one object in the scene should implement a trigger collider.

### Physics colliders (5%)

At least two objects in the scene should implement physics colliders. The collisions generated should affect the motion of at least one of the objects.

### Collision events (5%)

One or more game object should respond to a an appropriate collision event, from either a trigger collider or a physics collider.

### State machine (5%)

At least one object in the scene should be controlled using a state machine script with at least 3 meaningfully different states.

### Prefabs (5%)

A custom prefab should be used to generate multiple identical copies of one game object.

### Prefab - Dynamic Instantiation (10%)

At least one object should be dynamically instantiated from a prefab in a script.

### Object deactivation or destruction (5%)

At least one object should be deactivated or destroyed as a result of in game events.

### UI layout (10%)

UI elements should be laid out on the screen using the builtin Unity UI system. The UI layout should handle screen resizing appropriately.

### UI updating (5%)

The UI should be dynamically updated to respond to events in the game.

### Camera - Basic (5%)

The camera should follow the player avatar around the scene.

### Camera - Cinemachine (5%)

The Cinemachine system should be used to design a more complex camera movement for tracking the player avatar.

### Audio - Looping (5%)

Looping background music should play throughout the game.

### Audio - Events (5%)

Audio clips should be played to respond to in game events.
