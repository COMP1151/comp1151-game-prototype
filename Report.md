## Design Document (50%)
***Instructions***
The following Design Document sections should be completed, regardless of whether you have implemented the feature in your prototype or not. If you have not implemented the feature, your response should reflect any design decisions you would make you were to implement it in a future update to your game.
Please include screenshots and/or design diagrams/mock-ups to illustrate your point/clarify the discussion. Instructions for how to insert images into the Report.md are provided here: [How to Insert Images in Markdown](#how-to-insert-images-in-markdown)

### Experience (12 marks; 10%)
#### High Concept (2 marks)
Create a high concept for your game. Remember, a high concept should be include:
- What kind of game is it?
- What is unique?
- What is the player doing and feeling?

**Your High Concept (2 marks; 1–2 sentences)**
  > _Write here…_

---

#### Experience Goals (8 marks)
The prototype specifications specified that your game should focus on the primary player experiences of **Challenge** and **Drama** and the secondary player experiences of **Fantasy** and **Sensation**.
Explain how you refined each of these goals to establish a specific design vision for your game? 

[[REMOVE COMMENT]: The above wording is from the spec. If we change the wording there, then we should update the wording here, too.]
- **Challenge: (2 marks; 1-2 sentences)**  
  > _Write here..._

- **Drama: (2 marks; 1-2 sentences)**  
  > _Write here..._

- **Fantasy: (2 marks; 1-2 sentences)**  
  > _Write here..._

- **Sensation: (2 marks; 1-2 sentences)**  
  > _Write here..._

---

#### Satisfaction of Player Needs (2 marks)
- **Which of the SDT needs (autonomy, competency, and/or relatedness) is your game targeting and how? (1 mark; 1 - 2 sentences)**
  > _Write here..._

- **How have you designed your game to account for the impact of PENS (presence/immersion and intuitive controls / mastery of controls) on the satisfaction of the targeted SDT need(s)? (1 mark; 2 - 3 sentences)**
  > _Write here..._

---

### Mechanics (36 marks; 30%)
**Instructions**
-	In this section, we are looking at the mechanics of your game prototype.
-	Each question should be responded to. If you did not implement a mechanic in your game prototype, then you can base your response on how you might implement that mechanic in future design plans. You should indicate whether the response is reflecting your game prototype implementation or a future design plan.

---

#### Player Controls and Movement (7 marks)
- **What is the movement scheme for the player (e.g., 8-directional, physics-based)? (1 mark; short list response)**
  > _Write here..._

- **What is control scheme for player movement? (1 marks; short list response)**
  > _Write here..._

- **How does the avatar movement scheme align with the avatar and contribute to the fantasy of the game? (2 marks; 2-3 sentences)**
  > _Write here..._

- **How does the control scheme allow for skilful control and contribute to the challenge of the game? (2 marks; 2-3 sentences)**
  > _Write here..._

- **What expectation do you have for player familiarity with the movement and control schemes? (1 mark; 1-2 sentences)**
  > _Write here..._

---

#### Camera Design (4 marks)
- **How does the camera move in the game? (1 mark; 1-2 sentences)**
  > _Write here..._

- **How does the camera view support player movement during the game? (2 marks; 1-2 sentences)**
  > _Write here..._

- **What does the player need to see during play? (1 mark; 1-2 sentences)**
  > _Write here..._

[[REMOVE COMMENT]: concern this is ambiguously phrased – player needs to see the UI, but that would not be a consideration here. Yes, the UI shouldn’t obstruct view, but that would make more sense as part of the UI consideration section.]

---

#### Obstacles (2 marks)
- ** How obstacles affect player movement and require skill to navigate (2 marks; 2–3 sentences)**
  > _Write here…_

---

### Good and Bad Things (8 marks)

  > _Write here..._

- **How do good things reward skilful play and provide goals to motivate play? (2 marks; 2-3 sentences)**
  > _Write here..._

[[REMOVE COMMENT] This could also be phrased something like: “How do good things motivate and reward skilful play?” OR “How do good things provide goals to motivate play and reward skilful play?”]

- **How do bad things create tension & relief? (2 marks; 2-3 sentences)**
  > _Write here..._

- **How do moving good things/bad things create challenging navigation? (2 marks; 2-3 sentences)**
  > _Write here..._

---

Implementation Document
**Instructions:** 
This **Implementation Document** is where you indicate what you have implemented in your game prototype and where the markers will be able can find it within your Unity Project.

Each feature and the marks for implementing them in your prototype has been listed below. For each feature, you must:
1)	Indicate whether you implemented it in your game prototype or not.
2)	Indicate where the marker can find this feature within the Unity Project.
3)	Provide a screenshot(s) of the implemented feature with a caption.

**NOTE:** The marks indicated below reflect the marks for implementing each feature, not for completing the feature entry. This section of the Report is not worth marks directly, but it will aid in marking your prototype, so your grade could be negatively impacted if you have not completed this section and/or it is not clearly presented.
